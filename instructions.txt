install topojson module for node js
C:\>npm install -g topojson

C:\>topojson -s 7e-8 -p -o output.json input.json

For example:.
C:\>topojson -s 7e-8 -p -o West_Bengal.json file_path/West_Bengal.geojson

Where -s = simplification of the geojson points and 7e-8 is the amount of simplification on the geojson points
      -p = list of parameters (leave blank for getting all parameters)
      -o = output file name
	
Note: Once the conversion is done, please open the output file and check for the objects key in line 1	
For Example: West_Bengal.json(converted file):
{"type":"Topology","objects":{"West_Bengal":{"type":"GeometryCollection"
if the objects key is not same as the filename, the you have to manually change it accordingly.
